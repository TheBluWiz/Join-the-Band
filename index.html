      <h2>The Deal</h2>
      <p>The band doesn't exist yet, but it sure wants to. All we need are some bandmembers. If you wanna be part of our band, we can make some albums. We might also be able to books some gigs for the calendar or hang out. If you don't play an instrument, or know any thing about music, that's OKAY. We'd love for you to design us an album cover, or book us gigs, or hype us up. We're here to serve really. We just wanna be there for you. But we need YOU to make it happen.<br><br>Sign up for the band below</p>
